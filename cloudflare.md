How Service Uptime Monitoring works
-----------------------------------

Our worldwide monitoring stations conduct rigorous RFC-compliant protocol tests on your Web sites, servers, network services, ports and hardware devices like routers, etc. Each check interval (1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30 or 60 minutes), the next station in line takes its turn checking your server. If more than one location detects a connection failure, an email alert is sent to you. When your website is active again, you are notified as well. Following failure detection, SMS, e-mail and other contacts are notified.

Our monitoring software tracks all failures and logs detailed reports of the uptime/downtime of your website each day. These reports are available for you to browse in account control panel.

No software to install or changes to make to your web site. With 1 to 60 minute monitoring intervals, ServiceUptime will check your site from different worldwide locations and notify you via email or sms when it detects a problem.

Service Overview

ServiceUptime provides remote monitoring service for your website. We monitor server availability and performance externally from our worldwide network of monitoring stations. When your website goes down, we notify you instantly via email or SMS so that you may fix a problem before it costs you money, customers or reputation. In addition, we keep detailed statistics about your website's availability and response times so that you have the overall picture on your website availability and downtime.

Monitoring Frequency
--------------------

The monitoring frequency is how often your website is checked by our robot. You have the ability to monitor your website every 1, 2, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes. You choose the frequency of checks at your users control panel while setting up monitoring service.

Contacts supported
------------------

Upon service outage you can be notified by email and sms. Email notification is an alert with details of the service being down and the error it returns. SMS alert is a short notification sent to your cell phone with the status of monitoring service. You can also utilize Webhook and Jabber IM alerts or use ServiceUptime API to create your own application and alerting.

Services and Ports monitored
